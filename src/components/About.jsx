                    <p>Linnseed is a B2B web portal designed with a view to organize the unorganized cotton, yarn & agro industry. It's a Flexi ERP system curated with a view to digitalize the industry and create a revolution. The system allows you to register yourself as a buyer or seller of a particular category of products. Once registered, you can post your offerings or requirements and directly connect with buyers or sellers. Every user has their own account on our portal, where they can check for updates on their postings, order details, documentation, tracking, and even payment updates.
                        <br /> <br />
                        This eliminates hefty conversations, follow-ups, documentation, and all the inefficient time taking processes.
                            <br />  <br />
                        Just register yourself, post your requirements or offerings, and sit back. Linnseed does everything for you.</p>
